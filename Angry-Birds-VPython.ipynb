    "# A Model of *Angry Birds* in VPython\n",
    "This is a notebook to model an *Angry Birds*-style game in VPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "It aims to replicate the same mechanics as Angry Birds, modelling projectile motion, collisions and torque. \n",
    "The user inputs an initial velocity and angle above the ground for a particle to try to topple over a target some distance away in the x-direction. This model only considers motion in 2-D.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system follows a classical model, making several assumptions about the conservation of kinetic energy and momentum, amongst other things. I based the game mechanics on the equations outlined in Section 2 of the Final Assignment Script (Dash, 2019). \n",
    "\n",
    "The game mechanics follow an algorithm, which is outlined in Figure 2 of the Final Assignment Script (Dash, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the algorithm, I drew out a plan before beginning coding, planning which loops I would use. I decided to use a base *while* loop , to which I assigned the variable *win == False*, which ensured the code would repeat each time the user failed to topple the target. Only when the user topples the target does *win = True*, which leads the code to exit the loop, and lets the user know that they have won.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the base loop, I implemented a series of nested *while* and *if* loops. These are explained below."

    "\n",
    "1) *Changing the visibility of the label() objects.* From [3] I found the scene.waitfor() function, which I used to vary the visibility of the labels at different stages of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Keeping the labels at fixed positions throughout the game. From [4] I found that by setting *pixel_pos=True* I could keep the labels at fixed positions, which were dependent on the pixel coordinates, rather than on the reference frame of the equations of motion.\n",

    "Ultimately the VPython documentation proved very helpful."

    "## Possible Improvements to the Physics\n",
    "The game is very basic. I have made many assumptions in the physics to make it easier to code. There are several improvements that could be made so that the game would more accurately represent a typical classical system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The bird is assumed to act as a point-like particle. To create a more accurate model, the bird could be modelled to have angular momentum about its centre of mass. To implement this, a vector quantity could be introduced that acts rotationally, centred about the bird's centre of mass. Furthermore, in the code, the collision is between the centres of mass of the bird and the target, not between their outer edges. This could be improved by changing the position vectors of the collision to match the outer edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) It is assumed that the target cannot slide along the ground. Instead, a friction force F=ÂµR could be introduced, where Âµ is the coefficient of friction between the target and the ground, and R is the reaction force of the ground on the target. Âµ could change once the target starts sliding, as is observed in classical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The bird doesn't hit the ground after the collision. This could be implemented in the code by introducing another variable *ground = False*, which becomes *ground = True* after the collision, so that it falls.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The animation ends after the ball either collides with the target or hits the ground. To create a more accurate model, the animation could continue, and the bird could bounce, gradually losing kinetic energy until it comes to rest. This could be implemented by modelling the collision between the bird and the ground as inelastic and using a coefficient of restitution to find the kinetic energy lost after each bounce. I would use a while loop to iterate the loss of energy."
