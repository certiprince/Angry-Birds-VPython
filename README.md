# Angry Birds-style game in VPython

As part of my BSc Physics degree at UCL, I designed an interactive Angry Birds-style game in VPython

## In order to play the game, please follow these steps:
1) Save "Angry-Birds-VPython.ipynb" to your computer
2) Ensure you have Anaconda Python distribution installed on your computer
3) Run the following in your Command Line/Terminal (depending on your OS):
```jupyter notebook```
4) Open the file in Jupyter Notebook, which should have opened in your browser
5) Run all cells, and scroll to the user input cell to play!
6) Enjoy!
7) Read the markdown cells explaining the Physics behind the game if that's the sort of thing that interests you!
